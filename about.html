<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Nolan Adams. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, pursuing a BSE degree in Electrical Engineering.
<p>I have been fascinated by anything and everything electrical-or-mechanical-related for as long as I can remember. I have spent my whole life 
making, fixing, modifying, and otherwise tinkering with everything I could get my hands on (some of my past projects can be found on 
<a href="projects.html">this page</a>).</p>
<p>In middle and high school, I was involved in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a>. FIRST is an organization that
 seeks to foster science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills in students through a series of engaging competitions where students 
are tasked with designing and building robots to complete a variety of tasks. Through connections I made while in FIRST, I was able to intern at 
Robert Bosch, LLC.</p>
<p>While I was in high school, I wasn't just involved in FIRST as a student. I also mentored several middle school teams (including the one I was 
on while I was in middle school).</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>At this time, the best way to get in touch with me is via email:</p>
