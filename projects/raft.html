<h2>Raft: dragging FORTH into the modern age</h2>
<h4>2021 - 2022 (ongoing)</h4>

<p>About a year ago, I started learning about stack-oriented concatenative programming languages. That is, languages whose primary 
method of data manipulation revolves around interacting with a single stack. As I did more research on the topic, my interest 
grew, and I started taking an interest in FORTH. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a> 
is one such stack-based programming language, originally developed in the early 1970s by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore">Chuck Moore</a>. It continues to be used in specialized applications 
to this day, more than 50 years after its conception.</p>

<p>As such, <i>Raft</i> is the current working name for my most recent project: an implementation of a FORTH-compatible interpreted 
programming language, designed to combine some of the most convenient features of more modern programming languages with FORTH's simplicity.
I began this project after becoming inspired by Alexey Kutepov (Tsoding)'s <a href="https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth">Porth</a> project. 
Details of the project can be found in the GitLab repo here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/nolanpatrick/raft">nolanpatrick/raft</a>.</p>

<p>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<ol>
	<li>FORTH-compatible*</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Some programs written in FORTH should run natively in Raft with little-to-no modification.</li>
		<li>I don't plan on implementing the entire FORTH instruction set, but enough that it is usable as a language.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Approachable</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Syntax should (optionally) use familiar keywords that most beginner-level programmers would recognize.</li>
		<li>Program format mimics other popular languages like C, but retains the stack-based style of FORTH.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Easy to learn</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Familiar syntax combined with some modern amenities and a standard code layout should make it easy to get 
			started, even for someone with little exposure to similar languages.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Fun!</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't leave it to me to tell you that programming doesn't have to be boring. It should be fun, or at the very least, interesting!</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
