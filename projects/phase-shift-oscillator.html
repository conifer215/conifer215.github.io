<h2>Phase-Shift Oscillator</h2>
<h4>Oct. 2023 (ongoing)</h4>

<p>I have recently had a renewed interest in purely analog closed-loop circuits, especially the ones used long before digital systems were in everyday use. I also find 
oscillator circuits to be very interesting, so when I had a free weekend I took the opportunity to learn as much as I could about one such circuit.</p>

<p>Unlike the venerable NE555 Timer or Pierce Oscillator, which both create square waves, the phase-shift oscillator is one of a small number of commonly-used sine wave 
oscillators.</p>

<h3>Theory/Background</h3>

<p>For a closed-loop system to oscillate, it must meet a few requirements:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>The magnitude of the loop gain must be equal to 1 (or slightly greater in reality). This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkhausen_stability_criterion">Barkhausen stability criterion</a>.</li>
	<li>The phase shift of the entire feedback loop must be 360°.</li>
</ul>

</a>

<p>The theoretical phase-shift oscillator circuit is comprised of two main subsections:</p>
<ol>
	<li>An (inverting) amplifier stage (α)</li>
	<li>A feedback path with a phase shift of 180° (β)</li>
</ol>

<p>As I understand it, the basic operating principle of a phase-shift oscillator is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some low-energy signal (coupled noise, thermal noise, etc.) enters the forward amplifier path of the closed-loop circuit</li>
	<li>The amplifier increases the amplitude and inverts the signal</li>
	<li>This inverted signal enters the feedback path, where it is attenuated and the phase is shifted by 180°</li>
	<li>The phase-shifted signal re-enters the forward path and the cycle continues</li>
</ul>

<p>The amplifier can be considered to have a phase-shift of 180° due to its inverting configuration, as long as the input signal is periodic. The feedback path consists of 
reactive components which will together introduce a phase shift of 180° at a particular frequency. The phase shift of the amplifier cannot change (significantly), so the reactivity of the feedback 
path will cause the oscillation frequency to adjust until the total phase shift of the loop reaches equilibrium at 360°.</p>
