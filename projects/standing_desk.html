			<p>I built this simple standing desk from some scrap wood I had sitting around. This was a one-night project motivated by procrastination.</p>

			<p>I've wanted a standing desk for a while, but never wanted to spend the money to buy one. The opportunity to build one presented itself one night as I worked on
				something completely unrelated. I kept thinking "it would be nice to have a standing desk right now," and I realized I had a scrap of a shelf board left over from 
				an earlier project. I looked around and managed to scrounge together some scrap pieces of 2x1 boards barely long enough to build a miniature table with corresponding 
				side rails and legs. I ended up putting the whole thing together with only minimal hand tools, a few clamps, and an improvised square, using the concrete basement floor 
				as my workbench. It's certainly not perfect, especially considering how hastily I designed and put it together, but it works well enough to get the job done.
