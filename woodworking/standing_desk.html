			<p>I built this simple standing desk from some scrap wood I had sitting around. This was a one-night project motivated by procrastination.</p>

			<p>I've wanted a standing desk for a while, but never wanted to spend the money to buy one. The opportunity to build one presented itself one night as I worked on
				a lab report for one of my classes. I was looking for something I could justify doing instead of my class work, and I realized I had a scrap of a shelf board left 
				over from an earlier project. I looked around and managed to scrounge together some scrap pieces of 2x1 boards barely long enough to build a miniature table with corresponding side rails and legs.
				I ended up putting the whole thing together with only minimal hand tools and an improvised square while working on the basement floor.
			</p>

			<p>I won't pretend it's my finest quality work, especially since most of the joints are secured with reclaimed drywall screws and didn't use any stain or finish, but it's simple and does its job perfectly.</p>
