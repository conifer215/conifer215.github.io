<p>My name is Nolan Adams. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, pursuing a BSE degree in Electrical Engineering.
<p>I have been fascinated by anything and everything technical for as long as I can remember. I spend just about every free moment 
making, fixing, modifying, and otherwise tinkering with everything I can get my hands on (some of my past projects can be found on 
<a href="projects.html">this page</a>).</p>
<p>A huge part of my life has been defined by <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a>. FIRST is an organization that
 seeks to foster science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills in students through a series of engaging competitions. Students in middle and high school 
are tasked with designing and building robots to complete a variety of tasks. Now as an adult I mentor my former FRC team in order to give back to the 
program that did so much for me. In the past, I also mentored several middle school teams (including the one I was a part of while in middle school).</p>
