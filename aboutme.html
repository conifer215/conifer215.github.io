            <h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Nolan Adams. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, pursuing a BSE degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
            <p>I have been fascinated by anything and everything technical for as long as I can remember. I spend just about every free moment 
            making, fixing, modifying, and otherwise tinkering with everything I can get my hands on (some of my past projects can be found on 
            <a href="projects.html">this page</a>).</p>
            <p>A huge part of my life has been defined by <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a>. FIRST is an organization that
                seeks to foster science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills in students through a series of engaging competitions. Students in middle and high school 
            are tasked with designing and building robots to complete a variety of tasks. Now as an adult I mentor my former FRC team in order to give back to the 
            program that did so much for me. In the past, I also mentored several middle school teams (including the one I was a part of while in middle school).</p>
            <h3>Resume &amp; Contact</h3>
            <p>My resume can be found on <a href="resume.html">this page</a>.</p>
            <p>Contact information is available on the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
