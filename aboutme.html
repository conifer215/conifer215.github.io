            <h3>About Me</h3>
			
			<p>Hi, I'm Nolan! I am currently a student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, pursuing dual bachelor's degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
			
			<p>My interest in engineering and electronics started when I was very young, taking apart everything I could and building simple circuits. When I was in middle school I 
			joined a FIRST Robotics team at the FTC level, later moving up to FRC in high school where I eventually became the group lead for the Electrical group and later the Control 
			Systems group. In the past I have also volunteered at various FIRST events and mentored students at the middle school level.</p>

			<p>While working as an intern at Bosch, I have become familiar with the design and implementation of automotive/embedded electronics. I have gained experience in 
			various aspects of electronic hardware design, including circuit design, PCB layout, worst-case circuit analysis, switching converter stability, and transient simulation. 
			In addition to working with hardware, I have also done some software development using Python, MATLAB, and C++ (mostly for data analysis and visualization).</p>
			
			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>Electronics have always been a hobby of mine, so I do a lot of personal projects. I do writeups of the ones I think are more interesting in the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section of this site.</p>

            <h3>Resume &amp; Contact</h3>
            <p>My resume can be found on <a href="resume.html">this page</a>.</p>
            <p>Contact information is available on the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
